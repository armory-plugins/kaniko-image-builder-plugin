# kaniko-image-builder-plugin

_Note: This plugin is under active development and subject to change. Use with caution until there has been
a 1.0 release._

The `kaniko-image-builder-plugin` provides Spinnaker with a preconfigured job stage that leverages Kaniko
to build & push Docker images as part of a pipeline. This can be useful if you need to JIT build an image
before it is deployed. One use case for this would be deploying builds of an image from a PR or branch for
testing.
